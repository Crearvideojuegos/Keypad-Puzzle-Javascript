## About me

Hi! I write games and I like it! I'm Alex and welcome to my Github! I'm Gamedev and Gamedesigner and I upload my projects to Github to share them and discuss how they are programmed, which you will find later in this archive.

The reason is that I like my public repositories to be educational first and foremost. In the README you will find hints on how to improve the code!

If you like what I do, please follow me on my social networks!

## About the project

This project is a puzzle that originally appeared in the original Resident Evil.

In it, we must activate all the lights on the panel with the number buttons. The logic is simple, the light corresponding to the button and the adjacent ones horizontally and vertically will be reversed. If the light was off, it will turn on and vice versa.

## About the development and improvements

This project was originally done with HTML, CSS and Javascript for a website years ago... and I have done it again.

Recently I uploaded the [project done](https://github.com/IWriteGames/Keypad-Puzzle-Unity) in Unity and I have decided to redo it in web format. 

The reason was that I consider that it is an easy project for those people who are starting in programming, and so they can see two similar projects and the logic used in them.
